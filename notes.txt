Unit tests expect IllegalArgumentException when method's result is 0 (no results found).

General note: iteration can be faster than streams.
Results of timing tests:
    Building model sets from raw sets is takes the same amount of time with streams and with while/iterator and with forEach. Sometimes one option is faster, sometimes the other.
    Building model sets from raw sets is takes the same amount of time whether I use two streams (one for postal and one for political) or four streams (one for each model set). Sometimes one option is faster, sometimes the other.
    Therefore I decided to use four streams in ModelImpl constructor to improve readability

Methods of class ModelHelper could logically be methods of class Model. I put them in ModelHelper to reduce size of class Model.
To reduce size of ModelHelper, its methods could be split by which class sets they take as parameters e.g. PoliticalCommunitySetHelper and PostalCommunitySetHelper.

Fixed some spelling errors in original method names.

Cantons are largest administrative divisions on Switzerland.
Most but not all cantons are divided into districts.
Postal community / zip code can include parts of multiple cantons and districts.
Political communities are smallest administrative divisions in Switzerland.

If I add field Canton canton to District then model initialization is more difficult but some other methods are easier.

There is a possible test problem in getLastUpdateOfPoliticalCommunityByPostalCommunityName. To have 4064 PostalCommunities as expected in method testModel(),  political community numbers and postal community names are not compared when comparing PostalCommunities. Only zip codes and zip code additions are compared. Therefore a postal  community name can match multiple Postal Communities (e.g "Aarau") in provided csv file and one PostalCommunity can contain multiple political communities (e.g. "Aadorf"). Therefore getLastUpdateOfPoliticalCommunityByPostalCommunityName can have multiple possible answers.
